writing it all in markdown so that AI can rewrite it in latex.

# TITLE

* Something to do with quantum billiard in it, maybe mention the nodal line conjecture

# INTRODUCTION

* Something similar to my intro in my Project Plan, basically providing a key summary of what reading the paper is going to achieve. 
* Mention somme heursitics and popular culture things, to bring in some relation, and maybe some history.
* Somewhere I need to speak about the basics of dynamical systems. Maybe in the Mechanics section

# Chaotic Example: The Logisitic Equation 

* I think it will be a good idea to start with a simple system that can quickly show chaotic behaviour 
* Then when we discuss key topics, I can relate the to the previous example.
* Introduces the basic example of a iterative map, which will be useful when coming to Poincare Mappings
* Can pretty mmuch use what i wrote in my plan, with somme reformatting and applying fo the feedback from Stefan.

# Lagrangian and Hamiltonian Mechanics

* Need to start with basics of Lagragian mechanics to get to Hamiltonian mechanics, to then get to billiard systems.
* NEED to introduce Degrees of Freedom here
* Maybe worth mentioning holonomic constraints, but I am not sure it is necessary
* KEY THEOREM: Hamilton's Variational Principle - used to derive Euler-Lagrange Equations 
* Define the Hamiltonian through Legende Transformation - NEED TO LEARN BIT MORE ABOUT IT
* NEED to introduce constants of motion here, trajectories, orbits, conjugate momenta
* Then derive Hamilton's Equations - I am not sure on how we do that through just the Hamiltonian so NEED TO LEARN BIT MORE ABOUT IT
* could speak on symmetries, but likely not relevant
